# Break wall game
a c game using SDL2 graphics library
* the game is made using c 
* [SDL 2](http://libsdl.org) is a free cpp library
* feel free to use it anywhere!
* you can also check my profile for tutorials about SDL2 
* I developed a portable Code Blocks program for [SUT](http://www.en.sharif.edu) with internal SDL2 , SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf libraries! so forget all the problems about initializing SDL2 libraries !!
